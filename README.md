"I had the pleasure of working with Shawna while she was one of the key members from Accenture / Avanade team leading the students from University of California at Irvine in the Capstone course. During this course, leaders AI / Data Analytics from industry team up with student to utilize AI in addressing some of society challenges. 
Shawna led a data exploration and model development for predicting diabetes for different demographics in the state and helped build research-based credential.
Shawna led the team and did a great job - she is a true "Teacher at Heart" working well by helping and guiding the students vs. doing all the work and also "managed up" well when working with the professors. 
Thanks for the dedication, effort and the wonderful result. AI for the Good!!" - Marty Hodgett (Accenture Southern California Managing Director)

"Shawna has that rare blend of technical development and execution skills. She has demonstrated over her career the ability to develop deep research initiatives in the Data & AI space and then turn those ideas into action with a right execution. In particular, she has developed deep expertise around analytical solutions, with a focus on recommendation and propensity modeling. What's more Shawna is a hard working and a great communicator." - Rani Aknapuram (Avanade Group Manager, Data & AI)

"It is an honor to provide feedback for Shawna on her above and beyond contribution to UC Irvine Capstone program which is part of Accenture/Avanade university outreach program. 
UC Irvine Outreach Program started in 2021 and it was established to form a close partnership with a local university for recruiting top talents, working with students on projects which impacts our community and clients and amplify our brand awareness. 
Shawna is leading Capstone Program engagement. Capstone courses give UC Irvine students the opportunity to put their skills to the test by letting them work with Accenture/Avanade to solve real-world problems. 
Let me say this; this engagement would not have been a success if Shawna wasn't there and throughout the two quarters where she assumed a role of manager and mentor for three students. 
Prior to the course kick-off, there is a huge challenge around finding a real-world problem with publicly available dataset that student can use to build Data and AI based product. Shawna worked with extreme diligence to find a comprehensive dataset for the use case to predict diabetes for the overall demographic of California. Based on this, we established an AI based product vision that is oriented around welfare of local community that students would work on for next 10 weeks. 
Shawna did a fantastic job in challenging students at times with critical thinking and supporting students when needed - sometimes on weekends. Shawna led a data exploration and model development for predicting diabetes for population of California and helped build research-based credential which is ready to be published on a credible research journal.
Shawna showed extreme patience and dedication to solve the people-related challenges and tirelessly worked with students to motivate them on solving for this complex Machine Learning model. She would handle communication with students, professor and senior managers and lead sprint demo, provide progress report and escalate issues. Throughout the program, there wasn't a single problem that Shawna couldn't solve. If it wasn't for Shawna's dedication, students wouldn't have delivered such product and credentials which our firm can use as credential in H&PS practice to sell more work. Based on this experience, I am convinced that Shawna is ready for the next level, and I fully support her promotion." - Vishrut Chokshi (Accenture Los Angeles Senior Manager, Data Science Enablement & Delivery Lead)

"Shawna is doing amazing job in leading the Accenture relationship with UC Irvine. She is spearheading the entire effort around Capstone Program which spans across two quarters where student work on a problem that is assigned to them by Accenture in the area of Data and AI. As a lead of this program, Shawna worked on 1. defining a problem that is around social good 2. identified relevant data 3. developed deliverables and timeline 4. helping and transitioning students. In addition, she is doing exemplary job keeping open communication with executive sponsors, keeping complete command on deliverables, understanding and solving technical challenges along the way. I am super excited to see Shawna grow in this role and very thankful for all the hard work that she does for this effort." - Vishrut Chokshi (Accenture Los Angeles Senior Manager, Data Science Enablement & Delivery Lead)

"Shawna has done a great job as the data scientist on the project. She is the first data scientist to join our project and has been leading our AI workstream to deliver an initial output to our AI proof of concept.
Soon after joining, Shawna quickly understood the overall business objectives and familiarized herself with various datasets we are working with. It was impressive to see her breadth of knowledge and skill sets in the AI space. She led each of the steps required to reach our final output, starting from performing EDAs on the datasets, defining business logic and rules to choose the right model, and explaining the outputs and results to non-data scientists.
Shawna also demonstrated her ability to mentor a newer data scientist on the project. She was able to bring the newer resource up to speed quickly and effectively divide up tasks to meet our deadline. This was very helpful as we were targeting to produce meaningful results on a short timeframe. 
Shawna is a great asset to our project team and I encourage Shawna to continue her great work!" - Yeonjoo Kim (Accenture New York City Technology Manager)

"Shawna was my mentor for a project course that was done in conjunction with Accenture. She has been extremely helpful in her role, and was always quick and eager to give advice and feedback. It is clear that she is extremely passionate about her role and has an incredibly desire to make sure others are finding success." - Alvin Zou (UCI Data Science Graduate)

"I had the pleasure of having Shawna as my mentor for my UCI Data Science Capstone Project. Shawna mentored me for three months and provided advice not only on the project, but also on my career and personal life. She connected me with other professionals in the workplace who provided additional feedback on my project. What impressed me the most about Shawna was how passionate she was to make me succeed. She spared time on her days off to meet with me when I came across an issue in the project and patiently taught me when I made mistakes. I highly recommend Shawna because of how passionate she is about her job and how eager she is to share her knowledge with others to make them succeed." - Brian Wang (UCI Data Science Graduate)

"Shawna was the point of contact for a project my team was working on in conjunction with Accenture. Initially, her role was to answer any questions we had and provide some management over the progress and timeline of the project. However, Shawna went above and beyond in her mentorship. With regards to the project, she always made herself available to provide constructive feedback or give advice on how to approach problems we encountered. Outside the scope of the project, Shawna actively supported me by offering guidance on my career and ultimately helped me find a career path that I was not aware of before, but one that I believe is the right fit for me. She was able to empathize and understand who I was in order to make this judgement and I appreciate all of her words of encouragement and advice." - Kelly Im (UCI Data Science Graduate)

"Thank you so much for talking to me today. Your experiences working at Accenture as well as during your college years at UC Irvine were very insightful and inspiring. While your work is quite a bit overwhelming and amazing, I think that talking to you has definitely inspired me to forge a somewhat similar career path. I will look at these opportunities that you sent out and keep an eye out for any internships I can find there. Hope to see you soon when you come to UC Irvine!" - Riya Omprakash Mantri (UCI Undergraduate)

"Shawna was assigned to me as my mentor through the Avanade Scholars program. We talked about our interests and developed a relationship over our passions in technology. She connected me with various professionals in the cyber security industry and helped me get an internship at Avanade in security consulting. Shawna continues to mentor me and provide me advice both in my career and in my personal life. She truly is eager to share her knowledge and wisdom with other people, making her an amazing mentor." - Karina Rivera (Avanade Los Angeles Security Consulting Intern and Avanade Scholar)
