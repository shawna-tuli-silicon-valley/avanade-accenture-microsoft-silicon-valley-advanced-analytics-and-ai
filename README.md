"Shawna has done a great job as the data scientist on the project. She is the first data scientist to join our project and has been leading our AI workstream to deliver an initial output to our AI proof of concept.
Soon after joining, Shawna quickly understood the overall business objectives and familiarized herself with various datasets we are working with. It was impressive to see her breadth of knowledge and skill sets in the AI space. She led each of the steps required to reach our final output, starting from performing EDAs on the datasets, defining business logic and rules to choose the right model, and explaining the outputs and results to non-data scientists.
Shawna also demonstrated her ability to mentor a newer data scientist on the project. She was able to bring the newer resource up to speed quickly and effectively divide up tasks to meet our deadline. This was very helpful as we were targeting to produce meaningful results on a short timeframe. 
Shawna is a great asset to our project team and I encourage Shawna to continue her great work!" - Yeonjoo Kim (Accenture New York City Technology Manager)
